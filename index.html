          <p><mark>I love Code next bceause they have given me the greatest experience so far.</mark></p>
          <p><mark>They have taught me how to code.
          They also have given me info on how to get an internship at google and other info on how to get into other coding programes. Code Next has also provide me and other with summer programs. Also thanks to my Favorit middle school I was able to attend many <strong>UNICEF</strong> trips. That middle School allowed me to get accepted to Code Next.</mark></p>

            <h4 id="proj">Project</h4>
            <p><mark>my favorit project that I have done in Code Next is the haunted.js project that I worked on. It's the longest project that I ever worked on. Also I put all of my effert in that project and It's my favorit project because I learned how to organise my projests more when I worked on it. I was taught how to use TAB to keep things in my project linked together like a chain. What made this project so fun for me is I was able to be myself.</mark></p>

            <p><mark>you probley can't see it but this is a picture of mario farting. Just kidding! As you can see the picture to the right is my Haunted.js project which is my longest project so far.</mark></p>
